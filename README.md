Recently I had been fascinated with generative art and thought of learning it. I had taken a course on Domestika to learn about creative coding using JavaScript. Someone who loves to code and making visuals, I think this is a great place to get started.

In this repository I am sharing my learnings as well as few of my experiments. This course explores canvas-sketch, a framework for developing generative art with JavaScript. Matt DesLauriers is one of the contributors to canvas-sketch and also a creative coder and generative artist. 

## Get started with Node.js & npm

- Install the CLI tool globally
npm install canvas-sketch-cli -g

- Scaffold a 'sketch.js' file and open the browser
canvas-sketch sketch-01.js --open
